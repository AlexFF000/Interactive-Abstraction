Need to change AllocateNameProc to add a different call to createExpansion for when the global flag is set (note that tests won't notice that this isn't done)
Change generalCounter in AllocateNameProc to no longer be +3
Continue writing AllocateNameProc tests, and then run them.  The local tests can be the same as global ones but without the globalFlag set as global and local allocation work the same way for name pools.
Test compareExpectedVsActualPath
Need to consider whether to detect and throw error when a 32 bit number is provided to ADD without an A.  Spent ages sunday working out why output from calculateInstructionsLength was differnt to actual.  Though perhaps not a problem as long as it WOULD HAVE errored had the offending instruction actually been run (it was just skipped over as part of constand procedures)
