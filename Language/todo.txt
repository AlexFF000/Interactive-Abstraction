Use name lengths to check if slot is used, not type tag in _allocateSlot
Increment number of entries in _allocateSlot.  Then test
Set first byte after last slot in table to hold a nonzero value.  Also update tests to check for this
Test compareExpectedVsActualPath
Need to consider whether to detect and throw error when a 32 bit number is provided to ADD without an A.  Spent ages sunday working out why output from calculateInstructionsLength was differnt to actual.  Though perhaps not a problem as long as it WOULD HAVE errored had the offending instruction actually been run (it was just skipped over as part of constand procedures)
