Change generalCounter in AllocateNameProc to no longer be +3
Test compareExpectedVsActualPath
Need to consider whether to detect and throw error when a 32 bit number is provided to ADD without an A.  Spent ages sunday working out why output from calculateInstructionsLength was differnt to actual.  Though perhaps not a problem as long as it WOULD HAVE errored had the offending instruction actually been run (it was just skipped over as part of constand procedures)
